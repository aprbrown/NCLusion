# NCLusion

This is a class project for a mobile based web app to enable groups of students to meet and take part in a treasure trail around Newcastle upon Tyne. The backend is a built in NodeJS using express to define a RESTful API and uses MongoDB as the database. The front end is built in React and the intention was to migrate this to a Cordova project to utilise the bluetooth on an Android device, however this was not achieved in time for submission of the project.
